Tools for working with CSDMS Model Metadata

The CSDMS Model Metadata provides a detailed and formalized description
of a model. This includes information about:

-  Identifying information about the model. For example, model
   author(s), citations for the model, URL to the source code, etc.
-  A description of the model API, if it has been wrapped with a Basic
   Model Interface. This includes, for instance, how to build the model,
   depending on the language, what include statements are needed, etc.
-  A description of input file parameters. This includes default values,
   acceptable parameter ranges, units, etc.
-  Template input files. These are a set of input files that contain
   special markup where parameters from the metadata parameter
   description can be placed.
-  A description of how to run the model from the command line.

The CSDMS Model Metadata is extensible and not yet complete. New
metadata will most certainly be added in the future. We believe the
current specification provides a minimum amount of information needed to
describe a model to be either run as a standalone model or, possibly, to
couple with another model.

Whereas the BMI answers run-time queries of a model (e.g.Â the current
time of a model simulation, the value of a particular output variable),
the CSDMS Model Metadata provides a static description of a model. The
Model Metadata, along with a BMI implementation, allows a model to
automatically be incorporated as a component in the CSDMS PyMT.

Identifying information about the model.

   info:
       summary:
         Sedflux3D is a basin filling stratigraphic model. Sedflux3d simulates
         long-term marine sediment transport and accumulation into a
         three-dimensional basin over time scales of tens of thousands of years. It
         simulates the dynamics of strata formation of continental margins based on
         distribution of river plumes and tectonics.

Model Metadata Tools
====================

The CSDMS *model_metadata* Python package provides tools for working
with CSDMS Model Metadata. Contained within this package are tools for:

-  Reading and parsing model metadata that follow the CSDMS Model
   Metadata Standards.
-  Setting up model simulations either programmatically or through a
   commandline interface. Although model metadata may describe models
   with different interfaces, the model metadata tools provides a common
   interface for staging simulations.
-  Validing input parameter units, ranges, and type checking. If, for
   instance, a user provides an input value that is out of range, an
   error can be issued.
-  Running simulations, which have already been staged, through a common
   interface.

These tools are currently used by:

-  The Web Modeling Tool server to validate input parameters and stage
   model simulations.
-  The CSDMS Execution Server and PyMT for running BMI-enabled models.
-  Commandline utilities for quering model metadata, and staging model
   simulations.
